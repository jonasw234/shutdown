# shutdown_in
Simple Python script to shutdown the computer in the future

Usage:
    shutdown_in.py 10h30m20s
    shutdown_in.py 25m
    shutdown_in.py 300s
    shutdown_in.py 20 (assumes seconds)

I often have a show running in the background and go to bed. This script helps me shutdown my computer after it is done without me having to calculate the time in seconds by hand which is the only unit the builtin shutdown command recognizes.
